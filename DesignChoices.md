I have not created an api before so this was a steep learning curve and I used videos online to help me structure it. At first I used reqparse and set up different required arguments for /add and /update i.e. /add would require all fields be filled in and /update would not. Also, I was able to return the relevant status codes like 404 and 201. But I ran into many issues, like not being able to connect to the database.

So I started from scratch using another website to help. This time I implemented html files and template pages to redirect to after each action. However, I couldn't figure out how to return the records as JSON dictionaries without creating a second database connection. Although this now works and the actions are working correctly, the database does not update after each action. The flask session must be killed and restarted to view the changes.
